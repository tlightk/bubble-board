# Bubble Board
From one person to another, display all your loving messages in one place with the Bubble Board!

This project was conceptualized with the idea of displaying people's messages at social gatherings (which would then be displayed on a big TV screen). Going to a birthday party and want to let people know that the punch is so good that it literally and figuratively knocks you out? Or how about leaving a message for a secret admirer that had been eyeing you at the reunion? Whatever your thoughts are, share your vibes with others using the bubble board!

Created in React (JavaScript) utilizing:
- dayJS for converting date to relative time
- tsparticles for particle effects
- react-transition-group for modals
